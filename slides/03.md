# State Management

😖 It's a hard problem.

> React is a state management library

If you're building an application with React, you already have a state
management library installed in your application. You don't even need to npm
install (or yarn add) it. It costs no extra bytes for your users, it integrates
with all React packages on npm, and it's already well documented by the React
team. It's React itself.
