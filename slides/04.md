# Server Cache vs UI State

These two are not the same thing...

1. **Server Cache** - State that's actually stored on the server and we store in
   the client for quick-access (like user data).

2. **UI State** - State that's only useful in the UI for controlling the
   interactive parts of our app (like modal isOpen state).

1. Local State: Refers to state persisted within a React Component.

2. Tree State: This is the state that relates to a slice of a given React
   component tree. Typically in this setup youâ€™ll have a parent component that
   maintains the state for all its children and passes that state through via
   props or react context.

3. Global State: Refers to state persisted within a global store that all
   components have access to.

4. Server State: Refers to state persisted on a server

Use React for UI state.

Use [`react-query`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for your server cache.
